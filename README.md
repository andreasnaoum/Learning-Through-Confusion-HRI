# Learning Through Confusion in Human-Robot Interaction: A Pilot Study with Furhat Robot

This repository contains the code for a project developed as part of the **DD2413 Social Robotics** course at **KTH Royal Institute of Technology**. The project demonstrates how the Furhat social robot can be used to explore the role of confusion in learning and engagement during human-robot interactions.

## Project Overview
The interaction includes:
- Welcoming participants and asking if they want to learn about AI.
- Explaining AI concepts such as supervised and unsupervised learning.
- Asking follow-up multiple-choice questions to reinforce learning and assess understanding.

The goal is to examine how creating and resolving confusion can impact user engagement and learning outcomes.

## Features
- Interactive dialogues designed to introduce and explain AI concepts.
- Game-like elements to make learning more engaging.
- Feedback collection through multiple-choice questions to evaluate understanding.
- Automatically generate a file for participant with duration of each question, attempts, hint used, correct answer. 

## Requirements
- **FurhatOS SDK**
- **Kotlin 1.8**
- Any IDE or editor supporting Kotlin development (e.g., IntelliJ IDEA).
